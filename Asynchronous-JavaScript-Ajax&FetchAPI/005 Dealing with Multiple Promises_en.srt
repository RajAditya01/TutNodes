00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,770
Hello, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,480
In this video, I want to discuss about how can dealing with multiple parameters?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,040
I show you the life example, then that will be very interactive.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,490
I simply will be everything.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,950
And first of all, I want to do and declare two of these promises.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,150
I hope you already know that is a variable I take on.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,880
Namely, does a promise a promise one?

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,530
OK.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,340
And then the two, I want to turn to declare this promise.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,760
That is to declare that new and then promise.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,060
I simply declare I'm here to do part two of this parameter, right?

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,450
And here there is a function with the function of the end 12:02.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,210
This parameter one parameter will be as a result.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,000
And also the parameter function will be as a result, right?

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,610
And how what exactly the result, what exactly that I reject.

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,830
I hope you already know about it.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,120
If you get perfect data, then you can display with the result rather than if there are any add or we

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,220
can build it with this respect, right?

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,160
So simply take both of this.

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,090
And here I declare the array function.

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,480
OK.

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,790
That is the added function.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,379
And now I want to declare on the set time out and this time down to declare the added function.

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,500
OK, that is our function and this function area here.

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:16,050
I want to do that every function and I want to run our result, get a result and enter this result variable

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,300
to pass one of the value as a one.

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,670
OK.

28
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,610
I simply pass one of the value of the one, and this one below will display our time out.

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,160
Time out will be added 2000 2000 millisecond.

30
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,500
OK, that is after that two.

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,210
Second that should we display other results?

32
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,600
One.

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,080
Right.

34
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,600
And also take another one I copied.

35
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:40,530
And then I pasted that will be as a promise to OK, you just simply name it as a promise to and then

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,210
that will be the result again.

37
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,390
And from here, I intended to pass it to value.

38
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,810
OK, so that is or it will be resolved by pass one.

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,750
And also in here, I pass that as a two.

40
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,520
So now if you want to display both of these, then what exactly you have to do, then that is a promise.

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,280
And then there is another matter the all method.

42
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,340
OK, so here we have to declare this all method and into this All-Nighter area.

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,330
I think that both of these with the added I have the two things that one is the promise promise one

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,740
and also the other one, the promise to promise to assembly.

45
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,090
Take both of these in here.

46
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,780
And then with this, then this then method into this the method.

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,480
I understand the pass on the result.

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,910
That means our response, OK, Balderas response.

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,950
And then do that with this added function, we decided to function, want to do and this played out

50
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,460
of his play or this console and then the console log into this console.log area on the display or who

51
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,700
used that under this blower?

52
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,750
This test data?

53
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,490
OK, here I have already get it.

54
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,050
I get both of these response data in all this parameter as a response.

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,620
And here I just simply painted.

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,110
OK.

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,460
And if they have any error, then what exactly you have to do?

58
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,430
We have to display it.

59
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,980
We don't get it right.

60
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,950
So that is all them.

61
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,260
And also that is another one as a catch.

62
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,020
So now I want to do two and also but use it, that is where the dock catch method, right?

63
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,060
That is a catch method seem to discuss properties that have any error, then that will be possible.

64
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,780
The error?

65
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,630
OK, but that name of that or and then they were at a function on the display, this arrow to the console

66
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,330
and then the console log.

67
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,260
I'm here to learn to parse this out.

68
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,310
OK.

69
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,250
I think at the point you already knew about it.

70
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,920
So now if you click on this, save, all right now, they have narrowed down the actual display to have

71
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,270
this dark back look at the refresh.

72
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,300
So after the two second tier inconsistent display or fast blue as a one and the other two, right?

73
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,730
So this ad agency, though, still perfectly displayed the one below two values.

74
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,740
So here I simply take as a one.

75
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,380
So you see this result here I pass one below and here there is another one as it developed.

76
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,130
So now if you want to display that error here, I have already loaded the catch.

77
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,600
But also with this catch method is to work with which one is that we work with respect, right?

78
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,890
So that is a risk.

79
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,770
And into the street, Victoria Island would be split on the message.

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,490
So if the display, then that would be the new and our outer object.

81
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,810
So that is our object.

82
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,150
And here what of the message you want to display?

83
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,560
Like, there have some issues.

84
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,050
So this step one of the masses that will be displayed right now if you click on the save all now, if

85
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,940
you go to the refresh.

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,360
So first of all, that will display consistent display as if they have some issues right out front,

87
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,930
you get the idea how to deal with multiple promises.

88
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,440
OK.

89
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,690
So thanks for watching.

90
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,650
I will see you in the next video.
