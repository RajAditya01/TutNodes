00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,650
Hello, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:07,320
In this video, I want to discuss about another Caldbeck alternative as a that's okay here, I want

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,210
to do in this video to discuss about the promise, a promise.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,110
So how that promise actually work, like, first of all, I want to do.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,060
I simply won't be everything.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,320
OK, I remove everything from this area, and here I want to add on the set.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,670
Timeout seemed to set them on what I have already discussed about the things we do that will burn the

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,630
function right?

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,060
So this function, after the particular time, you can actually display some of the message like here,

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,250
I put that to the console.log here.

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,820
I named the high RDM, high RDM.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,850
So this step of one of the masses after the two second, that will be displayed, right?

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,170
So here we have to do have to pass it like a three seconds for the three seconds.

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,270
That is a three thousand millisecond gap in the three second.

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,580
OK, so here after the three second that we display our high RDM message and I will look at the savon

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,130
now go directly to the refresh.

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,640
So after the three second now so successfully display art, this message, which is totally fine.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,130
So now on to do I'll declare on the promise.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,430
We will declare that will in the corner structure.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,710
And here I take one of the promise, I promise, and I want to just declare the new promise so that

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,410
it was a promise, a promise.

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,670
So I simply load it.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,190
And here that will be the callback function.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,420
So that is a callback function.

25
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,540
And this function actually part two of this parameter one is the result that I return and address.

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,710
There is a parameter.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,910
OK, so here you can see that is also display other result parameter and also outside of the parameter

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,950
as a result.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,670
So first of all, to do until they meet, as a result, get a result and also another parameter and

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,330
then reject.

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,620
OK, reset reset.

32
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,080
So with this to have this parameter, how what exactly that will be the result.

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,930
Actually, this function worked for, we knew perfectly.

34
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,850
Get some of the data from your database, then that the result function will be executed.

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,310
And if there have any adult who is getting that data and see what it's getting that that I believe they

36
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,580
have any arrow, then our reset function will be executed.

37
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,120
OK.

38
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:15,360
So first of all, to do here, but I want to show you the live example I take out of the set timeout

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,890
and here you can use it as a function area.

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,980
So I use that as a function, our function functionality, I just simply declare, OK, I'll just simply

41
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,610
declare it.

42
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,370
And now I want to turn to this display.

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,000
One of the messages, OK, so one of the messages will be get that message.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,380
If we get perfectly data, then we can actually display it with the result function.

45
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,880
So this resolve area here I want, then that would be done as a one.

46
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,350
OK.

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,150
And also after we start missing, we get this data.

48
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,970
I just make it there after a three second or two seconds, after two seconds till we get all of the

49
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,360
data.

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,300
So I simply added that our timeout in here.

51
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,830
So that is a timeout.

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,710
I simply load it and I hope you already know about it.

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,620
So here I am actually parsing that with the result function.

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,660
That is one that means if they have everything OK, even if it's perfectly good, is that if everything

55
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,310
OK, then that will be as a result.

56
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,380
And then if they have any arrow, they can display it with this redirect function, OK, then how it

57
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,280
can actually display, then we have to display it with the respect that is a risk.

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,190
And even with this reject area here, just simply click, OK.

59
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:17,760
Oh yeah.

60
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,290
So that is our arrow.

61
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,050
And then your message like here, hi, there.

62
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,710
Like there are some arrow.

63
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,400
So this type of one on the arrow, then that will be display.

64
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,640
So I hope you give someone the idea with this result.

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,040
If you want to a parcel tax taxes, well, we can pass it if they have any at all, you can pass it

66
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,590
with this result, and that will be your error message.

67
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,450
OK, so that is at our object.

68
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,370
So that is not the default object.

69
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,020
So we this or object, you can actually display all that your address, but your demand.

70
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,500
OK.

71
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,070
I hope you get some idea how that promises actually work.

72
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,400
So now if you want to print this data right now, you don't need this.

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,900
I simply remove it, OK?

74
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,070
I simply removed it.

75
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,480
And here that is the last one.

76
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,200
And after this, I want to turn the display over this variable that in the console console.log, there

77
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,300
is a console look and here I want to display our promise.

78
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,520
OK, so that is upgradable.

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,540
I simply load it.

80
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,760
So now what exactly should we do after that two seconds that should be displayed on the message right

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,420
now, if you look at save all now, if you go near the refresh now consistent display as it promises

82
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,500
as a painting.

83
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,200
OK, so here right now, it's actually all this total data and this display, depending.

84
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,060
So how can actually solve this issue?

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,160
So first of all, I want to discuss about that.

86
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,860
Our result?

87
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,780
OK, results here.

88
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,900
I wanted to close it and there is a resolve here.

89
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,540
From here, I pass on that one, right?

90
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,030
So if you want to access this function, there are the two methode as a then and cast method.

91
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,740
OK, so I show you like here.

92
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,210
I want to do one to access it.

93
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,600
So that will be as I just named to the promises.

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,420
And then then my thought, OK, so that is the map would seem to this then matter really are here.

95
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,830
On the function, I simply decline the function and whatever the result, if we get here, I want to

96
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,780
pass on the perimeter as a result.

97
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,150
OK, I passed one of the parameters as a result crate.

98
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,740
And now with this result, we can actually paint that missile to show that console.

99
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,950
Log into this console.log area here and deposit that result.

100
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,860
OK, sorry result.

101
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,440
So I simply pass this result to our everything.

102
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,310
OK, if they have perfectly good this data here, I pass on that one below, right?

103
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,590
So now if you want to access this resolved, then as I told you, there is a two method one is that

104
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:39,190
the method and the catch method for now with this their method here, I pass one on the function and

105
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,260
I give this our total data.

106
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,940
That means that is our result, right?

107
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,450
So here I pass one of the parameters, the result, I name it, as a result.

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,820
And now I simply lauded this result.

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,950
Now if you click the save all now you go because refresh now after that two second, it should be displayed

110
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,980
the one you can see.

111
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,510
It's now successfully this bloody one.

112
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,370
OK, fine.

113
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,080
I hope it is very much clear to you.

114
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,300
And now if you want to display that every sick message, then you can also display better here.

115
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,110
Want to make it as a reject function, according to the resistance mounted on to declare the error message.

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,830
So we declared declare that it must, as I have already discussed, a vote of the arrows.

117
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,150
And if this are, or what type of arrow do you want to display, you can display like I just make it

118
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,740
as, hi there, there have been some error.

119
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,550
OK, so this step up on the message now that will be displayed.

120
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:34,580
So if you want to access this restrict function, then you have to use it as it gets OK for the result.

121
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,430
You have to use that as a method and for the reject, you have to use that as it gets method.

122
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,380
Now let's do that work here after this.

123
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,360
After this, I wanted to declare another method OK, here I'll declare and the method I did not catch.

124
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,190
So there is a catch method.

125
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,580
So into this catch method or facsimile tool with them into the function or whatever the result I will

126
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,540
get, I make out or OK, this double barreled message.

127
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,970
I pass on the parameter.

128
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,900
And now on to do under display that is a console and then the console log on to parse that out.

129
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,620
OK, I simply pass it.

130
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,930
So here that is our reject.

131
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,000
And then here I pass on this gene value.

132
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,210
Now with this catch method that will be connected with our this is a function that will be disallowed.

133
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,460
This message not only is it as to save all.

134
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,240
And now if you go if you go, click on the refresh after the two second, OK, you can see snapshot

135
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:31,090
display as at or hi, there have something at or OK, I often it's very much clear to you.

136
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,520
And also here you can see display.

137
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,870
The total things right is display the total error and then that is the message.

138
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,660
So if you want to only display that message that in this message, then you can also display it, then

139
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,140
that will be the dot and then the message, OK, message.

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,120
That means that these are at object or on the property as a message, and I want to do have to declare

141
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,190
it now because I save all now.

142
00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:00,090
That should be display only that message after the two second, yeah, because it's not successful display

143
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,240
only the message I unfriend you give someone the idea about that promise.

144
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,650
So is very much interactive.

145
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,750
One of the things I make that sure you understand it.

146
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,160
So thanks for watching.

147
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,140
I will see you in the next video.
