00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
Hello, friend, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,620
You know, previous video I have discussed about that feature.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,020
Yeah.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,750
And here, first of all, we knew Ronnie Dennis actually passed one of the branches, right?

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,410
And for the reasons here, when you get that as a promise, then you're going to be able to access that

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,770
then and catch right.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,120
So not only do I want to apply the same things with using another functionality that is that I think

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,570
carried that we don't need to use that then or the catch one that is here, that same functionality.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,369
OK, that means user that I simply get it with that just on right to the JSON that we get that all the

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:32,820
data.

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,580
So that going to do the same things with using another form raped right now.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,970
But I want to do here.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,800
I want to make it as a comment out, OK.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,540
And now here I want to do first of all, I want a picture of the function that is a function.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,410
And here I name, it doesn't get in full form from it.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,730
OK.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,930
Getting from it.

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,510
And here I simply declare one of the function.

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,440
And when you use that synchrony, then first of all, here we have to do.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,180
We have to add that async run.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,440
OK, that is and see, I think Graham.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,030
And here we have to, first of all, call it and then that will be our function.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,990
And I just put that function name as a gate info.

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,390
Far from it.

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,720
OK.

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,860
In full, I just naming, does it get info from that?

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,220
So in particular, that position, first of all, we have to do, we have to call the same things.

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,650
We have to get that out.

29
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,620
We have to fetch all that.

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,450
Our API so simply pasted took that is our constant variable as a gate API.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,960
And with this guide API, I just simply fact all the data.

32
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,340
OK?

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,600
I simply fetch all that data bit and I want to do under displayed so fully displayed and that will be

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,720
I take another variable, the constant variable.

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,130
I just name it as a profile.

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,870
OK, name it does a profile.

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,280
So with this profile?

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,900
First of all, here we have to do.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,390
We have to get that before I get this data with this then and then our test on method, right?

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,230
So now all we have to do, we have to run this JSON.

41
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,600
So I simply copied and here I paste so that with this, that will be actually fetch all that the user

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:00,990
data.

43
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,310
OK, and now when using that as an gurnett, then here all you have to do.

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,030
We have to use that.

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:06,750
Our it.

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,560
OK, now wait.

47
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,919
So here we have to use it as a function.

48
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,220
So now with this, our function, then that is our JSON map todo till we get all that data, which everything

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,230
is right now in our this variable as a profile variable.

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,440
Now I want to turn to this play this profile.

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,720
That means that with this console, sorry that the console with this console.

52
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,200
So now with this console, log into this console to print out this profile, right?

53
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,230
And to bring this profile here, you can see I didn't use any -- gas.

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,950
That is one.

55
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,550
Form it, we can use it rather than you can also use it, OK?

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,980
And now that is one of the function right now.

57
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,240
We have to do have to display this functionality from the display that we have to call this.

58
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,470
That is a gate that is our get info from gate, right?

59
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,530
So here I simply call our dysfonctionnement.

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,690
Now, if you click on the save all now, if you go click the refresh.

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,600
Now serving as the oncogene promise references to friends is not defined preferences.

62
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,910
Here you can see that could be.

63
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,440
Obviously, this names a bit.

64
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,590
I make it as a reference.

65
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,490
OK, so that it with references.

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,070
Now if you click on the save all.

67
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,280
And now if you go to the refresh again, there's a gists on there.

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,730
There is.

69
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,620
Jason is not a function.

70
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,120
This just on his daughter function.

71
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,900
You can see here.

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,470
Also, you have to do into the fat, into the search area here.

73
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,000
Also, we have to parse that out.

74
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,910
OK, so that is allowed on the function and then that is our fetch.

75
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,230
OK.

76
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,960
So here also, we have to add that, as I would add also here, we have to add that out right now.

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,860
Let's check this out.

78
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,630
Give you to save all now.

79
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,280
Go directly to the refresh.

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,130
Yes, you can see it's done successfully now.

81
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,170
Get all that user data.

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,790
OK, who's our followers?

83
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:58,710
User details everything because the logging details, location issues are all that object is now successfully

84
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,810
gated and now is visible in here.

85
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,310
I offering to give some idea how can work with these promises?

86
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,000
Also, another one of the grown up here.

87
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,910
You can actually do that.

88
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,980
Same things with using that hasn't grown up here.

89
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,459
All you have to do app tap to add that asynchronous element function and then before that fats.

90
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,890
Here you have to call this function as the output and also integrate the data with this JSON from it.

91
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,830
Then here also you have to add our OK, so that is a simple work with using that as in Gurnett.

92
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,360
And then that is all promises that I will produce very much clear to you in your next video and you

93
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,520
start a new session.

94
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,890
It's about the DOM.

95
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,400
Don't be mean, the document object model.

96
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,060
So step by step, I will try to share everything with you.

97
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,410
So thanks for watching.

98
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,290
I will see you in the next video.
